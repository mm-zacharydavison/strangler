# Project Tools

This project uses the following tools you will need to be aware of to run commands.

- `jj` -> for version control.
- `nvm` -> for managing node version.
- `pnpm` -> for package management.
- `jest` -> for tests.
- `biome` -> for linting.

# Running Commands

`nvm` is in use, the node version will have global tools like `pnpm` installed.
If you want to run a command like `pnpm`, run `nvm use` first.
